## Introduction

The *Ages of Man* project applies advanced statistical methodology on remote sensing agriculture. It is composed of several R packages, as well as other elements, each one focusing on a different application.

*cronus* is an R package that focuses on database creation. It can be used to download and process agricultural, environmental and satellite data from various sources. 

## Installation

You can install the stable version of *cronus* from CRAN by running the following line of code:

```{r}
